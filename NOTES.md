# Notes

## Weather

There are several different APIs available for retrieving current weather conditions and forecasts:

1. [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?MR=1)

### 1) Weather Underground

WU serves data over HTTP via JSON or XML. They offer a free service accessible with an API key, which you can get for free. I signed up for the "Anvil Plan" with limited ("Developer") access, and received an API key to use (saved in [wu.key]())
